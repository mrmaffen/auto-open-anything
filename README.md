## Auto Open Anything
A WoW addon that automatically opens all containers directly after looting them

Available on Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-open-anything

Features:
* Contains a list of all openable item ids currently in the game (as of 9.2.0)
* Feature to turn auto-opening on/off while you're in combat
* By default all locked containers are being ignored. This can be changed in the options
* All chat notifications are turned off by default. Also changeable in the options
* Quickly customize the list of containers you want to be opened automatically
* Launcher icon supports databroker addons like Titanpanel
* Similar addons might automatically sell some items to a vendor, which has cost me a few grey hairs in the past. This one never does.
* Disable auto-loot while mission table is shown to not interfere with other addons
